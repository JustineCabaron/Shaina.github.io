			<td class="td3">PUFF PASTRY</td>
			<td class="td4">
				<p>The traditional puff pastry has been around for generations and is the base of many wonderful pastries. The classic puff pastry is also known as Pâte feuilletée. In French, it means layered dough (laminated dough). The layers are made with just three main ingredients flour, water, and butter. And there is no leavening or yeast in this dough.</p>

				<p>The puff pastry is made up of three parts -- The flour knows as the détrempe in French, the butter block which is known as the beurrage, and the Pâton, which means the package of dough by combining the two, flour and butter block into one.</p>

				<p>We use it to make savory dishes like chicken pot pie and quick puff pastry pizzas, as well as in desserts like Napoleon, Nutella puffs apple turnovers, and more</p>

				<p>Often you will also see a recipe for quick puff pastry. This is basically a rough mixture of flour and butter combined. We do create a few layers but it is not the same as the classic pastry. It is quicker because it does not need any lamination time. The resulting pastry does turn out buttery and flaky but without even layers of pastry. It tastes delicious and very close to the classic. Definitely a great substitute if you can't make the classic.</p>

			<td class="td3">DANISH PASTRY</td>
			<td class="td4">
				<p>Danish pastry is a buttery, flaky, pastry made with a lamination similar to croissants and puff pastry. But, they are sweeter and have more butter and eggs. The Danish dough is not necessarily difficult, but it is time-consuming because we need to chill the dough in between steps.</p>

				<p>It's also a very forgiving dough that's easy to knead with a stand mixer or by hand. There are three main components to this pastry.</p>

				<li>The dough - this is simple yeast-based dough with eggs, butter, and sugar. It can be soft and sticky to work with, so don't skip the chilling times.</li>
				<li>Butter block - yes, it is lots of butter, which we cream with a little flour and then laminate between the dough. The purpose of the flour in the butter is to help stabilize it. Most professionals often skip the flour, but I recommend you use it.</li>
				<li>The fillings - usually this often could be cream cheese or pastry cream with a fruit filling or jam. It can also be just a fruit filling or jam.</li>

				<p>Also, there are many ways to shape the Danish pastry. We have covered this dough in great detail from the basic dough to shaping the Danish as well as individual pastries like Danish pinwheels, cream cheese cylinders as well as pastry cream pain au raisin.</p>

				<p>'Croissants de Boulanger' is a flaky, buttery French pastry that is a yeast-based dough laminated with layers of butter. And, then, shaped to create its distinct croissant shape. You will get lots of variations of fillings and shapes made from this basic dough. In this blog, I have made the classic croissants asThere are two main components to this dough: well as some variations like ham and cheese croissants and chocolate.</p>

				<p>There are two main components to this dough:</p>

			<td class="td3">FILO PASTRY</td>
			<td class="td4">
				<p>Of course, let's not forget the flaky filo or phyllo pastry. Filo is an unleavened pastry of very thin delicate sheets of dough. It has less moisture content so it does not rise like puff pastry.</p>

				<p>The filo layers are separated by melted butter or oil. They bake crispy and flaky. Often used in desserts like apple strudel, chocolate cigars, and baklava as well as savory recipes like samosa or crispy tarts.</p>

			<td class="td3">CHOUX PASTRY - PATE A CHOUX</td>
			<td class="td4">
				<p>Choux pastry pronounced 'shoe pastry' is a French dough called pate a choux, which means 'cabbage paste'. Well, apparently, the little baked puffs resemble small cabbages. 
				Hence, the name.</p>

				<p>The basic dough is cooked twice. First, it's cooked on the stovetop. Then, piped into small puffs and baked into the light and airy pastries. You can also fill them to make impressive desserts like cream puffs, profiteroles, and eclairs.</p>

				<li>Cream puffs - Cream puffs are a great way to make impressive desserts that wow your guests. Using homemade choux pastry from scratch, you can fill these with whipped cream for a quick and tasty treat.</li>
				<li>Profiteroles - The classic French dessert profiteroles are made with choux pastry that is light as air. And, they are filled with vanilla pastry cream, whipped cream, or ice cream, and finished with a chocolate glaze.</li>
				<li>Eclairs - The classic eclair also uses the choux pastry dough but we pipe them into long tubular shapes. Filled with pastry cream, whipped cream, or fruit fillings, etc. Often, with a chocolate glaze too.</li>
				<li>Churros - These are deep-fried treats. And yet, do you know that it uses the choux pastry dough as a base? Yes, instead of baking the choux pastry, we put the dough in a piping bag and we deep-fry it until golden and crispy. Often dusted with cinnamon sugar and served with a chocolate sauce or ice creams.</li>
